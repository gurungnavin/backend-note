## HTTP/HTTPS 🌐

### Introduction
- **HTTP**: The language apps and servers use to communicate.
- **HTTPS**: The secure version of HTTP that encrypts data.

### Usage
- **HTTP**:
  - Used for sending requests (e.g., fetch data) and receiving responses.
  - Example: Fetching a webpage (`GET`), submitting a form (`POST`).
- **HTTPS**:
  - Used for secure communication (e.g., login, payments).
  - Example: Logging into your bank account.

### Why It’s Important
- **For Developers**:
  - Handle requests (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) and send responses.
  - Use HTTPS to protect sensitive data.
- **For Users**:
  - HTTPS keeps their data safe from hackers.

### The Careful Part: Security
- Without HTTPS, data is like a **postcard**—anyone can read it.
- With HTTPS, data is like a **sealed letter**—only the recipient can open it.
- Always use HTTPS for sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payments).
